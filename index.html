<h1 id="nasaspublicgithuborganization">NASA's Public GitHub Organization</h1>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>This organization is intended to publicly host NASA code that has been SRA-approved for open source. </p>

<h2 id="Who">Who</h2>

<p>Only NASA staff can release code in github.com/nasa org. </p>

<h2 id="How">How</h2>

<p> For information on how to become a member of the NASA Org (you need to be a NASA civil servant or contractor with access to systems inside the NASA firewall), please see the instructions on code.nasa.gov/#/guide. Additionally, see "Request Process" below.</p>

 
<h1 id="heading2" style="margin-top:2em;">Instructions for NASA Org on Github.com Once You Are a Member</h1>

<h2 id="repos">Repos</h2>

<p>We do not give out admin rights on any NASA Github repos. If you want a new repo created or want to edit settings on an existing repo that require admin access, please contact one of our org owners</p>

<h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>

<p>Teams are effective ways of managing repository access privileges for an entire group of users. Only org owners can create and remove teams, but we now allow users to be team maintainers. Team maintainers have permissions to add and remove users to their teams. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Team maintainers are <em>technically</em> able to add a user who was once in the org back onto their team (thus reinstating the user in the org). However, we <strong>do not allow this</strong> and will remove maintainers who are found in violation. If you need a past member to be reinstated in the org, contact an org owner and request to be added as an outside collaborator.</p>

<h2 id="outsidecollaborators">Outside Collaborators</h2>

<p>On a case-by-case basis we will allow non-NASA users to be added to the org as Outside Collaborators.</p>

<h2 id="owners">Owners</h2>

<p>We currently have two active owners in the org:</p>

<ul>
<li>Taylor Yates (evan.t.yates@nasa.gov)</li>

<li>Justin Gosses (justin.c.gosses@nasa.gov)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please reach out to us if you have any questions.</p>

<h3>Code.nasa.gov</h3>
<p>Please make sure any repos added here are also tracked in code.nasa.gov! Placing open-sourced code on https://code.nasa.gov is a congressional mandate. Additionally, all code projects on code.nasa.gov will get harvested into code.gov, which improves discoverability for the public and enables federal government wide tracking of open-sourced code.
